<h1>DAS Data Explorer</h1>

<p>
    Data Explorer is the single-point of user interactions, which allows you to carry out different operations related
    to data analytics. Data Explorer allows you to search and view tables in the Data Access Layer (DAL) of WSO2 DAS,
    and browse their records. You can authorize and restrict users on the functions that they carry out using the Data
    Explorer, by setting permissions on the user roles assigned to them as shown below.
